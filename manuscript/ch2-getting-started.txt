# How to get started with Flink

NOTE: You many want to start from reading [Quickstart: Setup](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/quickstart/setup_quickstart.html).

After you have built your own local Flink distribution or downloaded it from the web, you start Flink using the following command:

```
$ pwd
/Users/jacek/dev/oss/flink

$ ./build-target/bin/start-local.sh
Starting jobmanager daemon on host japila.local.
```

Visit [Apache Flink Dashboard](http://localhost:8081/#/overview) (aka _JobManagerâ€™s web frontend_).

## SocketWindowWordCount Example

Start `nc` in a terminal.

```
$ nc -l 9000
```

Open another terminal and `run SocketWindowWordCount`.

```
$ ./build-target/bin/flink run ./flink-examples/flink-examples-streaming/target/SocketWindowWordCount.jar \
  --hostname localhost \
  --port 9000
